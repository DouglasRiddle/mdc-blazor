# mdc-blazor

The initial development of this library was done during my employment at [John Brown University](https://www.jbu.edu). 
The original intent of the library was to use Blazor components to give our development team an easy way to implement
[Material Design components](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web)
without each member having to learn the material components web implementation specifics.

A huge thanks to [Steve Sanderson](https://github.com/SteveSandersonMS) for his [RazorComponents.MaterialDesign](https://github.com/SteveSandersonMS/RazorComponents.MaterialDesign) repo which served as the initial
foundation. And thanks to the greater open source community for their shared knowledge and expertise. â™¥
